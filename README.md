# Java Chess Game

This is a simple chess game made in Java that runs in the terminal. Please note that this game is a work in progress and may have bugs or incomplete features.

## Installation

To get started, you will need to download the source code for the game. You can do this by cloning the repository:

```
Once you have the source code, you can compile and run the game in your preferred Java compiler. The main class is Chess.java, which you can run to start the game.

## Usage

The game is played in the terminal with a text-based interface. The board is displayed as a grid of letters and numbers, with the pieces represented by symbols. To move a piece, enter the starting and ending positions of the piece, separated by a space. For example, to move a pawn from e2 to e4, you would enter "e2 e4".

The game follows standard chess rules and allows for all basic moves, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. However, some more advanced features such as checkmate detection and move validation are not yet implemented.

## Customizing the Game

If you would like to customize the game, you can modify the source code as needed. For example, you can add new pieces, modify the board layout, or implement new game features. The source code is well-commented to help you understand how the game works.
